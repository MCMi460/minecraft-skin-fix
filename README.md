# Minecraft Skin Fix
Minecraft Skin Fix is a simple vibe.d server that runs on a local machine to redirect requests for skins and capes on old versions of Minecraft (for example, Beta 1.7.3) to the modern skin and cape APIs.

## Compiling
To compile you need a D compiler and dub, the D package manager. Everything should be set from there.

## Tips
You can modify the code to have manual exceptions to redirect certain player skins to others, and the same with capes.
